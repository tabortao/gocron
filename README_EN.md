## Requirements

* Go 1.23+
* Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (see notes below)
* Node.js 20+ (for frontend development)

## Database Support

| Deployment Method | MySQL | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|-------------------|-------|------------|--------|
| Docker Deployment | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Supported |
| Binary Deployment | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Development Environment | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |

**Notes**:
- **Docker Deployment**: Due to cross-platform compilation limitations, Docker images do not support SQLite. Please use MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **Binary Deployment**: Supports all databases including SQLite (suitable for lightweight deployment and testing)
- **Production Recommendation**: Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for better performance and distributed deployment support

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose Deployment

Deploy using Docker with local image build:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/gocronx-team/gocron.git
cd gocron

# 2. Start services (automatically builds image)
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Access web interface
# http://localhost:5920
```

**Notes**:
- Docker Compose only deploys the gocron management server. Task nodes (gocron-node) need to be installed separately
- Docker images do not support SQLite. Please use MySQL or PostgreSQL database
- If you need SQLite, please use binary deployment (see "Production Deployment" section below)
- Refer to the "Production Deployment" section below for gocron-node startup instructions

### Development Environment

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/gocronx-team/gocron.git
cd gocron

# 2. Install dependencies
go mod download

# 3. Configure database
# Edit ~/.gocron/conf/app.ini
# For MySQL/PostgreSQL: see examples in project root
# For SQLite: copy app.ini.sqlite.example

# 4. Start backend (with hot reload)
air

# 5. Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd web/vue
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:8080

### Binary Deployment (Recommended)

Suitable for production environments, supports all databases (including SQLite):

```bash
# 1. Build and package
make package

# 2. Extract the package for your platform
tar -xzf gocron-package/gocron-*.tar.gz
tar -xzf gocron-node-package/gocron-node-*.tar.gz

# 3. Start service
cd gocron-*
./gocron web

# 4. Start task node (in another terminal)
cd gocron-node-*
./gocron-node
```

Visit http://localhost:5920

## Agent Auto-Registration

gocron supports one-click generation of installation commands through the web interface. Simply execute the command on the target server to automatically install and register the Agent node.

### Usage

1. Go to the "Task Nodes" page in the web interface
2. Click the "Auto Register" button
3. Copy the installation command for the corresponding platform
4. Execute the command on the target server

### Supported Platforms

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
curl -fsSL http://your-server:5920/api/agent/install.sh | bash -s -- <token>
```

**Windows (PowerShell with Administrator privileges)**
```powershell
iwr -useb http://your-server:5920/api/agent/install.ps1?token=<token> | iex
```

### Features

* ✅ One-time token with 3-hour validity period
* ✅ Token can be reused within validity period, suitable for batch installation
* ✅ Automatic download, installation, registration, and startup of Agent
* ✅ Automatic creation of systemd service on Linux
* ✅ Automatic creation of Windows service on Windows
* ✅ Secure one-way communication (Agent only accesses gocron during registration)

## Commands

### gocron

```bash
gocron web              # Start web service
gocron web -p 8080      # Specify port
gocron web -e dev       # Development mode
gocron -v               # Show version
```

### gocron-node

```bash
gocron-node             # Start task node
gocron-node -s :5921    # Specify listening address
gocron-node -enable-tls # Enable TLS
```

## Project Origin & Acknowledgments

This project is developed and refactored based on [gocron](https://github.com/ouqiang/gocron). I really appreciate the design philosophy of the original project, but since the original author is no longer maintaining it, I have done extensive refactoring work on this foundation, including:

* Complete internationalization support (Chinese/English switching)
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) security features
* Automatic log cleanup system
* Modern Vue3+Vite frontend architecture
* Backend web framework refactoring (upgraded to modern [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework)
* Database migration tool refactoring ([gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm)-based automatic migration system)
* Multi-database support (especially added SQLite support for lightweight deployment)
* Fixed several critical issues (Shell task stop functionality, orphaned task handling after system restart, etc.)
* Better user experience and interface design

Thanks to the original project author for their contribution. I also hope everyone will give the project more stars and submit more issues to encourage the project's development. Let's improve this project together!
