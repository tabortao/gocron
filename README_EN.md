gocron web -p 8080      # Specify port
gocron web -e dev       # Development mode
gocron -v               # Show version
```

### gocron-node

```bash
gocron-node             # Start task node
gocron-node -s :5921    # Specify listening address
gocron-node -enable-tls # Enable TLS
```

## Project Origin & Acknowledgments

This project is developed and refactored based on [gocron](https://github.com/ouqiang/gocron). I really appreciate the design philosophy of the original project, but since the original author is no longer maintaining it, I have done extensive refactoring work on this foundation, including:

* Complete internationalization support (Chinese/English switching)
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) security features
* Automatic log cleanup system
* Modern Vue3 frontend architecture
* Backend web framework refactoring (upgraded to modern [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework)
* Database migration tool refactoring ([gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm)-based automatic migration system)
* Better user experience and interface design

Thanks to the original project author for their contribution. I also hope everyone will give the project more stars and submit more issues to encourage the project's development. Let's improve this project together!
